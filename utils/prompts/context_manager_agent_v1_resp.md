I'll help you implement the Context Manager Agent based on the specification. Let me first explore the existing codebase to understand the current structure and then present you with a plan and options.

Based on the comprehensive specification document, I'll help you implement the Context Manager Agent for your multi-agent system. Let me analyze the requirements and present you with a structured approach.

## **Plan: Context Manager Agent Implementation**

I need to complete the implementation of the Context Manager Agent that integrates with three storage layers (Vertex AI Vector Search, PostgreSQL, and Neo4j) to provide contextual information for Privacy Sandbox-related queries.

### **Key Implementation Steps:**

1. **Initialize the Context Manager class** with proper configuration and data manager integration
2. **Implement the 4 required custom tools** as methods within the agent
3. **Implement the core query processing workflow** following the specified logic flow  
4. **Add proper error handling, logging, and LLM response generation**
5. **Integrate with Google ADK** following the established patterns

### **Required Custom Tools:**
- `retrieve_relative_documents(query: str)` - Vector similarity search
- `retrieve_document_metadata(document_ids: List[str])` - PostgreSQL metadata retrieval
- `retrieve_entity_relations(document_ids: List[str])` - Neo4j entity relationships
- `combine_relevant_context(docs, metadata, relations)` - Context consolidation

## **Implementation Options:**

### **Option 1: Full Implementation with All Storage Layers**
**Pros:** 
- Complete integration with vector search, database, and knowledge graph
- Comprehensive context retrieval capabilities
- Follows specification exactly

**Cons:** 
- More complex to implement initially
- Requires all three storage systems to be properly configured

### **Option 2: Incremental Implementation (Vector + Database First)**
**Pros:**
- Start with core functionality (vector search + metadata)
- Easier to test and debug
- Knowledge graph can be added later as noted in specification
- Faster initial implementation

**Cons:**
- Not complete initially
- May need refactoring when adding knowledge graph

### **Option 3: Mock Implementation with Real Integration Points**
**Pros:**
- Quick to implement for testing
- Easy to replace mocks with real implementations
- Good for development workflow

**Cons:**
- Not production-ready immediately
- Additional work to replace mocks

## **My Recommendation:**

I recommend **Option 2: Incremental Implementation** because:
- The specification already suggests implementing knowledge graph "later" 
- Vector search + database provides core functionality
- You can test and validate the agent immediately
- Neo4j integration can be added seamlessly afterward

**Which option would you prefer for the Context Manager Agent implementation?**

Please let me know your choice, and I'll proceed with implementing the selected approach following Google ADK patterns and best practices.

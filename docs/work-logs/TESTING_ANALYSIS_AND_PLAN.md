## ⚠️ Critical Issues Identified

### 🔍 **1. Cross-System Data Consistency Problem**

**STATUS**: 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUE REQUIRING IMMEDIATE ATTENTION**

```
Current Overlap Metrics:
├── Vector ∩ Database: 0.00% overlap
├── Database ∩ Knowledge Graph: 0.00% overlap  
└── Vector ∩ Knowledge Graph: 0.00% overlap
Overall Consistency Score: 0.42/1.0
```

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- **Recent UUID Generation**: ✅ **FIXED** - New chunks have proper UUID format
- **Legacy Data Contamination**: 🚨 **ACTIVE ISSUE** - Vector store contains malformed "UUIDs"
  - `web:-4712555691632663023:chunk:0`
  - `rtCamp/ps-analysis-tool-wiki:Home.md:chunk:3`
  - `drive:14T3F5S9p6d9YuJoBPungvmrSvf1d7W6ebujWSpLfUEc:chunk:19`
- **Indexing Delays**: Vector search returns old data while database has fresh data

### 🕸️ **2. Knowledge Graph Query Issues**

**STATUS**: ⚠️ **OPERATIONAL BUT SUBOPTIMAL**

```
Issues Identified:
├── Missing confidence_score property warnings
├── Entity type validation errors (EntityType.NONE)
└── Zero entities returned for most queries
```

**Impact**: Knowledge Graph functional but not optimally integrated with retrieval flow.

        # 3. Measure overlap at different time intervals
        overlaps = []
        for delay in [1, 5, 10, 30]:  # seconds
            await asyncio.sleep(delay)
            overlap = await self.measure_cross_system_overlap(expected_uuids)
            overlaps.append((delay, overlap))
        
        # 4. Validate convergence to high overlap
        final_overlap = overlaps[-1][1]
        assert final_overlap.vector_db_overlap > 0.9

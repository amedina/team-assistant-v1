**AI-Assisted Exercise:**
```
Prompt: "Create a simple BookCard component that takes props for title, author, and rating. Include a button that toggles between showing/hiding a description. Explain each part of the code as you write it."
```

### Day 3-4: State Management Basics (2-3 hours)
**What to Learn:**
- useState hook
- When to lift state up
- Controlled vs uncontrolled components
- Basic event handling

**AI-Assisted Exercise:**
```
Prompt: "Build a TodoList component with the ability to add, delete, and mark todos as complete. Walk me through your state design decisions and explain why you chose this approach."
```

---

## Week 2: Patterns & Architecture (5-6 hours)

### Day 5-6: Component Patterns (2-3 hours)
**What to Learn:**
- Container vs Presentational components
- Custom hooks basics
- Composition patterns
- When to break components apart

**AI-Assisted Exercise:**
```
Prompt: "Refactor this TodoList into separate components following React best practices. Create a custom hook for the todo logic. Explain your architectural decisions."
```

### Day 7-8: Data Flow & Effects (2-3 hours)
**What to Learn:**
- useEffect hook and dependency arrays
- Data fetching patterns
- Error boundaries concept
- Loading states

**AI-Assisted Exercise:**
```
Prompt: "Build a UserProfile component that fetches user data from an API. Include loading, error, and success states. Show me how to handle the component lifecycle properly."
```

---

## Week 3: Real-World Application (4-5 hours)

### Day 9-10: Putting It Together (2-3 hours)
**What to Learn:**
- File/folder organization
- Component communication patterns
- Basic routing concepts
- Performance considerations

**AI-Assisted Exercise:**
```
Prompt: "Create a mini blog application with a post list, individual post view, and the ability to like posts. Structure this as a multi-component application and explain your organization strategy."
```

### Day 11-12: Advanced Patterns (2 hours)
**What to Learn:**
- Context API for prop drilling
- Reducer pattern for complex state
- Higher-order components concept
- Render props pattern

**AI-Assisted Exercise:**
```
Prompt: "Add a theme system to our blog app using Context API. Create a ThemeProvider and show how components can consume the theme. Explain when Context is the right choice."
```

## ðŸ”§ Essential Concepts to Master

### 1. **Component Mental Model**
- Components are functions that describe UI
- Props flow down, events flow up
- State lives where it needs to be shared

### 2. **State Management Decision Tree**
- Local state: useState for simple component state
- Lifted state: when multiple components need access
- Context: for deeply nested prop drilling
- External state: for complex app-wide state

### 3. **Common Patterns Recognition**
- List rendering with keys
- Conditional rendering patterns
- Form handling approaches
- Error boundary placement

### 4. **Performance Awareness**
- When re-renders happen
- Expensive operation identification
- When to optimize vs premature optimization

## ðŸ¤– AI Prompting Strategies for React

### Effective Prompts for Learning:
1. **"Explain your reasoning"** - Always ask AI to explain architectural decisions
2. **"Show me alternatives"** - Ask for different approaches to the same problem
3. **"What are the tradeoffs"** - Understand pros/cons of different patterns
4. **"Refactor this code"** - Practice improving existing code

### Effective Prompts for Building:
1. **Start with requirements:** "I need a component that does X, Y, Z"
2. **Specify constraints:** "Keep it simple, no external libraries"
3. **Ask for structure:** "Break this into logical components"
4. **Request best practices:** "Follow React best practices and explain why"

### Code Review Prompts:
1. **"Review this React code for best practices"**
2. **"Identify potential performance issues"**
3. **"Suggest improvements for maintainability"**
4. **"Check for accessibility concerns"**

## ðŸ“š Quick Reference Resources

### Essential Hooks Cheat Sheet:
- `useState(initialValue)` - Local component state
- `useEffect(() => {}, [deps])` - Side effects and lifecycle
- `useContext(MyContext)` - Consume context values
- `useCallback()` - Memoize functions
- `useMemo()` - Memoize expensive calculations

### Common Patterns:
```jsx
// Conditional Rendering
{isLoading ? <Spinner /> : <Content />}

// List Rendering
{items.map(item => <Item key={item.id} {...item} />)}

// Event Handling
const handleClick = (e) => { /* logic */ }

// Controlled Input
<input value={value} onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} />
```

## ðŸ’¡ Pro Tips for AI-Assisted React Development

1. **Start with wireframes** - Sketch the UI before prompting AI
2. **Break down complex features** - Request one component at a time
3. **Ask for tests** - Include testing in your AI prompts
4. **Request TypeScript** - Even if you don't know TS, it helps with documentation
5. **Iterate incrementally** - Build features step by step with AI
6. **Ask "What would break this?"** - Learn edge cases and error handling

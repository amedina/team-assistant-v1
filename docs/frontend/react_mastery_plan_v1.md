## ðŸ”§ Essential Concepts to Master

### 1. **Component Mental Model**
- Components are functions that describe UI
- Props flow down, events flow up
- State lives where it needs to be shared

### 2. **State Management Decision Tree**
- Local state: useState for simple component state
- Lifted state: when multiple components need access
- Context: for deeply nested prop drilling
- External state: for complex app-wide state

### 3. **Common Patterns Recognition**
- List rendering with keys
- Conditional rendering patterns
- Form handling approaches
- Error boundary placement

### 5. **Next.js Architecture Understanding**
- App Router file conventions (page.js, layout.js, loading.js, error.js)
- Server vs Client Component decisions
- When to use SSG vs SSR vs Client-side rendering
- API Routes for backend functionality

### 6. **Full-Stack Mental Model**
- Frontend and backend in one codebase
- Database integration patterns
- Authentication flow understanding
- Deployment and production considerations

### 7. **Vercel Platform Awareness**
- Git-based deployment workflow
- Environment management (development, preview, production)
- Performance monitoring and analytics
- Edge functions and global distribution

## ðŸ¤– AI Prompting Strategies for React & Next.js

### Effective Prompts for Learning:
1. **"Explain your reasoning"** - Always ask AI to explain architectural decisions
2. **"Show me alternatives"** - Ask for different approaches to the same problem
3. **"What are the tradeoffs"** - Understand pros/cons of different patterns
4. **"Refactor this code"** - Practice improving existing code
5. **"Show me the Next.js way"** - Learn framework-specific best practices

### Effective Prompts for Building:
1. **Start with requirements:** "I need a Next.js app that does X, Y, Z"
2. **Specify architecture:** "Use App Router with server components where appropriate"
3. **Include deployment:** "Make this ready for Vercel deployment"
4. **Request optimization:** "Optimize this for performance and SEO"

### Next.js-Specific Prompts:
1. **"Should this be a server or client component?"**
2. **"Set up the proper file structure for this feature"**
3. **"Add API routes for this functionality"**
4. **"Configure this for production deployment"**
5. **"Optimize the loading and error states"**

### Code Review Prompts:
1. **"Review this Next.js code for best practices"**
2. **"Check if I'm using server and client components correctly"**
3. **"Identify potential performance issues"**
4. **"Suggest improvements for SEO and accessibility"**
5. **"Verify this is production-ready for Vercel"**

## ðŸ“š Quick Reference Resources

### Essential Hooks Cheat Sheet:
- `useState(initialValue)` - Local component state
- `useEffect(() => {}, [deps])` - Side effects and lifecycle
- `useContext(MyContext)` - Consume context values
- `useCallback()` - Memoize functions
- `useMemo()` - Memoize expensive calculations

### Next.js App Router Patterns:
```jsx
// Server Component (default)
async function BlogPost({ params }) {
  const post = await fetch(`/api/posts/${params.id}`)
  return <article>{post.content}</article>
}

// Client Component
'use client'
function InteractiveWidget() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(c => c + 1)}>{count}</button>
}

// API Route Handler
export async function GET(request) {
  return Response.json({ data: 'Hello World' })
}

// Layout Component
export default function Layout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html>
      <body>
        <nav>Navigation</nav>
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```

### Common React Patterns:
```jsx
// Conditional Rendering
{isLoading ? <Spinner /> : <Content />}

// List Rendering
{items.map(item => <Item key={item.id} {...item} />)}

// Event Handling
const handleClick = (e) => { /* logic */ }

// Controlled Input
<input value={value} onChange={(e) => setValue(e.target.value)} />
```

### Vercel Configuration:
```json
// vercel.json
{
  "env": {
    "DATABASE_URL": "@database-url"
  },
  "regions": ["iad1"],
  "functions": {
    "app/api/**": {
      "maxDuration": 30
    }
  }
}
```
